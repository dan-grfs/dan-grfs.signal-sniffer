# Documentation Directory

This directory is for project-specific documentation.

## Purpose

Use this directory to store:
- Hardware setup guides
- Wiring diagrams
- Project-specific notes
- Troubleshooting guides
- Any other documentation relevant to your project

## Getting Started

When starting a new project from this boilerplate:
1. Remove this README or update it with your project's documentation structure
2. Create documentation files as needed for your specific hardware and setup
3. Reference documentation in your README.md and hardware skill files

## Organization Suggestions

- `setup.md` - Development environment setup
- `wiring.md` - Wiring diagrams and connections
- `troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- Hardware-specific docs as needed
